Delink Comment Author gives you the ability to remove the link a commenter left as their URL without removing the entire comment.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'delink-comment-author.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Delink Comment Author.


== Usage ==

Click on the link in your comment e-mail notification or in the comment list to remove the commentors link from their comment.


== Known Issues ==

Adding the link to the comment list requires jQuery, which is included in WordPress 2.2 and later.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the link appear in my comment list? =

See the Known Issues above.

= Do you plan to release a version compatible with versions of WordPress prior to 2.2? =

No, and for security reasons it is a good idea to keep your version of WordPress up to date.

= Anything else? =

That about does it - enjoy!
